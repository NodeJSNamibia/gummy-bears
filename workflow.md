# Collaboration Workflow
The following describes the **workflow** governing our collaborative process. At any point in time there should at least two branches. First the *master* branch, which contains the code in production. Whenever a new version is push to the master branch, an automatic deployment task (thnking of Grunt) installs the new code on the respective production machines. As such we strive for **hot deployments**. A specific team member will be granted the privilege to merge to the master branch.

The stage before the **master** branch, is the **develop** branch.
